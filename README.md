### Abstract

In this paper, we address the problem of rain streaks removal in video by developing a self-learned rain streak removal method, which does not require any clean groundtruth images in the training process. The method is inspired by fact that the adjacent frames are highly correlated and can be regarded as different versions of identical scene, and rain streaks are randomly distributed along the temporal dimension. With this in mind, we construct a two-stage Self-Learned Deraining Network (SLDNet) to remove rain streaks based on both temporal correlation and consistency. In the first stage, SLDNet utilizes the temporal correlations and learns to predict the clean version of the current frame based on its adjacent rain video frames. In the second stage, SLDNet enforces the temporal consistency among different frames. It takes both the current rain frame and adjacent rain video frames to recover the structural details. The first stage is responsible for reconstructing main structures, and the second stage is responsible for extracting structural details. We build our network architecture with two sub-tasks, i.e. motion estimation and rain region detection, and optimize them jointly. Our extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, offering better results both quantitatively and qualitatively.
